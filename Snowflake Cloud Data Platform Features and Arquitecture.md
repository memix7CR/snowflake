# Cloud Data Platform and Arquitecture

## Service

- OLAP SaaS
- Native SQL based on public cloud (not on-prem options)
- Decoupled storage - computation


## Storage

- Data objects not directly visible (except via SQL)
- Storage managed by Snowflake


## Query Processing

- Virtual Warehouse to process queries
- Each VW is am independent MPP (Massive Parallel Processing) compute cluster

## Arquitecture 

- Hybrid of traditional **shared-disk** and **shared-nothing**

### Caches

SF caches different data to improve query performance and reducing costs

#### Metadata cache   :arrow_right:   Cloud Services Layer

- Improve compile time for queries against commonly used tables

#### Result cache    :arrow_right:   Cloud Services Layer

- Holds the query results
- If customer runs exact same query within 24 hrs, result cache is used (no warehouse is required)

### Local Disk/Warehouse/SSD Cache :arrow_right:   Storage Layer

- Caches the data used by SQL query in its local SSD and memory
- Improves query performance if same data was used (less time to fetch remotely)
- Cache dropped when the warehouse is suspended
