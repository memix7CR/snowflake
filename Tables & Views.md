### Micro-Partitions

- Snowflake tables are divided in micro-partitions
- Micropartitions are compressed-columnar data:
  - Max size of **16MB** (compressed), **50-500MB** (uncompressed)
  - Data is available by SQL not directly
  - Immutable once created
- Data ingestion order dictates partition of the data
- Natural clustering is used by Snowflake to colocate the data with same value or range
  - It helps to avoid overlapping of micro-partitions and less clustering depth
  - Improve query performance avoiding scanning unnecesary micro-partitions

- **Clustering Key**
  - Recommended once your table grows really large (multi-terabyte range)
  - Clustering Keys are subset of columns designed to colocate the data in the same micro-partitions

### Zero-Copy Cloning

-Enable cloning tables
- Snowflake references the original data (micro-partition) with no storage cost
  - When a change is made to the cloned table (update, insert, delete) then a new micro-partition is created (incurs storage costs)
- Cloned object does not inherit source granted privileges.


### Types of Tables

#### Temporary

- Use to store data temporarily
- Exists within the session (data purged after session ends)
- Not visibke to other users, not recoverable
- Default **1 day of time travel**

#### Transient

- Persist until **dropped**
- Same functions as permament table except not **Fail-Safe** mode
- Default **1 day of time-travel**


#### Permanent

- **7 days of File-Safe**
- Default **1 day of Time Travel** up to 90 days >= Enterprise Edition

#### External

- Allows access to data and query data stored in External Stage as in tables

**Snowflake doesn't enforce any constraints (primary key, unique, foreign key) beside NOT NULL constraint

### Types of Views

#### Non-materialized views

- Results are not stored

#### Materialized Views

- Results are stored
- Executed once created
- Faster performance than normal views
- Contributes to storage cost


#### Secure View

- Both materialized and non-materialized can be set as secured
- For data-privacy. Hides view definition and details from unauthorized viewers
- Performance is punished (internal optimization is bypassed)
