### Data Security

#### End-to-End Encryption

Snowflake encrypts all data at rest and in-transit **no additional cost**

#### Client Side Encryption (Internal Stage)

- If the stage is an internal stage data files are automatically encrypted by the Snowflake client on the user’s local machine prior to being transmitted to the internal stage.

#### Client Side Encryption (External stage)

- Client-side encryption means that a client encrypts data before copying it into a cloud storage staging area.

    - The customer creates a secret master key, which is shared with Snowflake.

    - The client, which is provided by the cloud storage service, generates a random encryption key and encrypts the file before uploading it into cloud storage. The random encryption key, in turn, is encrypted with the customer’s master key.

    - Both the encrypted file and the encrypted random key are uploaded to the cloud storage service. The encrypted random key is stored with the file’s metadata.
